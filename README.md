# cnn-model-from-scratch-coded-not-copied-
run this code in google collab , using custom dataset that i made of Assamese object for recognistion and detection with high accuracy by this model .

i used only 42 images for this , 21 in test and 21 for train ,and 21 in test , though it contaisns .xml file that i created after labellng images using labelimg

*ps : to use the model correctly : change path of test and train .
and use " epochs " + ( no. of iteration you want for each classes ? eg . 10/20/30 etc .
